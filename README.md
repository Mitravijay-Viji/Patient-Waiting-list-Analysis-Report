# Patient-Waiting-list-Analysis-Report
Overview
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Healthcare Data using the power of Power BI. In this comprehensive Patient Wait List Analysis Dashboard, we've harnessed the potential of various chart types such as donut charts, stacked column charts, line charts, multi-row cards, cards, slicers, and metrics to bring you a visually insightful representation of our healthcare statistics.

Project Goals
1. Track current status of patient waiting list
2. Analyse historical monthly trend of waiting list in Inpatient & outpatient categories
3. Detailed Speciality level and age profile analysis
   
This project consists of 2 pages.
1. Summary Page
2. Detailed View Page
   
Data Scope
2018-2021

Metrics Required:
1. Average & Median waiting List ( I have used median metrics to handle outliers present in the dataset)
2. Current Total Wait list

   
Steps covered to complete this project:

1. Data Cleaning & Processing in Power BI: In this project, I started by importing raw Health care data into Power BI. Before I could visualize and analyse the data, cleaning and preparation of data is required. This involved identifying and handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates. For this purpose I used Power BI's data transformation capabilities, particularly Power Query.
2. Power BI Dashboard Setup: Once the data was cleaned and processed, I set up the foundation for the Health care analytics dashboard. This included creating a new Power BI report and adding various visuals, which would collectively form the dashboard.
3. Import Data in Power BI: The next step was to import the cleaned Health care data into Power BI. This involved connecting to the data source (e.g., Excel, SQL database) and loading the data into the Power BI environment.
4. Power Query in Power BI: Power Query is a crucial tool in this project. I used it to transform and shape the data further. This included merging multiple data sources, applying advanced data transformations, and creating custom columns to derive insights.
5. DAX in Power BI: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) played a significant role in the project. I used DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures. For instance, I could calculate total wait list of patients, latest month wait list. Previous year latest month wait list, Average waiting list, Avg/median waiting list, median waiting list etc.
6. Measures and Calculations in Power BI: Within Power BI, DAX is used to define measures and calculations. Measures are dynamic calculations that respond to user interactions and slicer selections. This allowed us to provide real-time insights based on user needs.
7. Charts in Power BI: Charts and visuals are at the heart of data visualization. I have used various types of charts, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, to represent Health care metrics visually. This will help users to understand trends and patterns.
8. Filters and Slicers in Power BI: To enhance interactivity, I implemented three filter to analyse the data according to date, case type and speciality name These tools allowed users to select specific criteria, departments, time periods, or any other relevant data points. The visuals automatically adjusted to reflect the user's selections.
9. Dashboard in Power BI: The dashboard itself is a collection of interconnected visuals, charts, and tables. It presented a comprehensive view of Health care analytics, enabling users to explore and gain insights at a glance.
